In this course, we aim to specialize in artificial intelligence by working on 12 Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects at various levels. Before starting the course, you should have basic Python knowledge. Our aim in this course is to turn real-life problems that seem difficult to do into projects and then solve them using latest versions of artificial intelligence algorithms and Python(3.8). This course was prepared in July 2021.

We will carry out some of our projects using machine learning and some using deep learning algorithms. In this way, you will have a general perspective on artificial intelligence. When you complete the projects in our course, you will get a clear understanding of the basic working principles of Machine Learning software and Deep Learning algorithms and the difference between them.

In our course, we will use well known datasets that are widely used by high level education about Machine Learning as well as custom datasets. By doing our projects, you will master artificial intelligence concepts as well as learn these famous datasets. After completing the course, you will be able to easily produce solutions to the problems that you may encounter in real life.

In our Deep Learning projects we will use the latest version of Tensorflow and Keras libraries.

The course is composed of 12 Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning & Deep Learning) Projects:

Project #1: House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Project #2: HR Salary Calculation using Machine Learning

Project #3: Handwritten Digit Recognition using Multiple Machine Learning Models

Project #4: Advanced Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

Project #5: IMDB Sentiment Analysis Using NLP (Natural Language Processing)

Project #6: Building a Movie Recommendation System

Project #7: Predicting Diabetes using Artificial Neural Networks

Project #8: Image Classification using Convolutional Neaural Network and Artificial Neural Network Algorithms (Deep Learning)

Project #9: Airline Passenger(Time Series) Prediction using Keras LSTM (Deep Learning)

Project #10: San Francisco Crime Geographical Clustering using Machine Learning

Project #11: Image Classification (ImageNet Library) using Transfer Learning - Keras InceptionResNetV2 (Deep Learning)

Project #12: Military Aircraft (Satellite Imagery) Classification using Deep Learning (Custom Datasets)

Each project will be implemented by Python using Jupyter Notebook. Python source code of each project is included in relevant Udemy course section. You can download source codes for all projects..
